        <p>
            It's the year 2040, but what it brought to the Earth and humanity wasn't flying cars or exploration of other
            planets. There is no Internet, in fact. No mobile phones, tablets, personal computers. No self-driving cars or
            smart washing machines. The advanced technology, especially electronics, has abandoned humanity, simply ceasing
            to function properly, almost overnight. The world has changed - and this sweeping change, as unforeseen then as it
            remains mysterious today, came to be known by a name reflecting its enigmatic and sudden nature: "The Incident".
        </p>
        <p>
            The world after The Incident is much different from our own. The great cities are slowly crumbling to ruins -
            ghost towns, still as big as ever, but inhabited by only a fraction of their original population, largely
            abandoned as the old world came crashing down, taking with it the mighty bloodstream of supply lines that used
            to both bring in food and other necessities and remove all the garbage produced by these great urban centers at
            a rate most people remained blissfully unaware of - until the communal services failed, that is. The cities
            started struggling with supplying their inhabitants with the barest of minimums - and so the people abandoned
            them, sometimes literally just to survive. All that is in the past now, a memory from roughly two decades ago,
            but while the situation normalized with time and the cities no longer starve, there's also little reason for
            those who left and found their place elsewhere to come back.
        </p>
        <p>
            The old world came away and took many things that used to be considered obvious, nearly omnipresent. It did,
            however, bring things that the world never knew. Most notably, a small fraction of children born after the
            Incident has either been born with - or started displaying at some later stage of development - strange powers,
            often not completely controlled, sometimes considerably dangerous. These children became known as "Cursed" and -
            as they stand - society at large treats them, at best, with some degree of suspicion. At worst... well, let's
            just say that there are some groups that don't find the idea of literal witch hunts all that repulsive.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another significant entity that came to existence after the Incident is much less obvious - to the point
            where their very presence is either unknown or discarded as an urban legend by most. This relative obscurity,
            along with the fact that the boundaries between them and the ordinary people are so blurred, led to a situation
            where they're rarely given a name. Those in the know sometimes label them as "True Maters", "Exalted Masters"
            or, simply, "the Exalted" - as sort of a counterpart for "the Cursed". Unlike the latter, the Exalted do not
            exhibit flashy supernatural powers beyond their control, nor are their members limited to those born in the
            aftermatch of the Incidend. If anything, they are the very opposite: the people who truly mastered the ordinary.
            Men and women who reached the very peak of human competence in some area - and then surpassed it. With perfect
            control and sort of a spiritual understanding of their craft - they do the impossible. From deflecting bullets
            with a knife to hiding in a well-lit empty room so well that you might spend an hour inside and never realize
            you weren’t alone. From cooking a meal so great that it's <em>objectively</em> delicious, tasting well to
            everyone regarldess of personal tastes and dislikes, all the way to killing a hidden target with a tripple
            ricochet - if not with an outright curved bulet, making a convenient turn mid-air. It's like the reality itself
            looks away. As if they were a movie character capable of doing things just because they're cool. And while feats
            blatantly breaking the laws of physics might be exceedingly rare, with even the less obvious not-quite-realistic
            exploits being reserved for the best of the best, this doesn't change the simple fact: the world has changed. The
            most basic rules governing it have changed. And the player characters - being who they are - are sure to find
            themselves acutely aware of the fact, one way or another.
